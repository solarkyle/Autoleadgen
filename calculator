#This one is for just straight panels at 180 degrees, it would be pretty easy to have it multiply by a certain number for the azimuth, 
I just need to figure out, for example if we have 2 arrays on the roof, les say a 6 kw and a 3 kw, if the 6 kw is facing due east it would
get a dividor of like 0.85, due south would be 1.00, north would be like 0.75. I dont know the exact numbers yet, working on that.


numPanels = 42

with open('azimuth.yaml') as fh:
    azimuth = yaml.load(fh)

# Then you'd just call the value you want, like azimuth['S180']

wattage = numPanels * 300
cost = wattage * 2
taxCredit = cost * 0.3
gasOffset = wattage * 0.1483
avgProd = wattage / 55

print("We can fit " + str(numPanels) + " solar panels on your roof, which equals " 
      + str(wattage )
      +" total watts DC. The estimated cost for this sytem is $"  
      + str(cost)

 # output : We can fit 42 solar panels on your roof, which equals 12600 total watts DC.
